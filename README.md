My project is A device that can turn off any kind of tv so that I can go around my house and turn off the tv's to mess around with my family 
I made this because I thought it would be a fun way to expand my knowledge on electronics and have fun ! :)  also, somehow idk how, i ended up making this thing the size of 2 AAA batterys side by side        and here is the link for the ali express battery's
