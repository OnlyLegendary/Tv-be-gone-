## 1/24/2026 4 PM - I think i finished the electrical schematic?!  

_Time spent: 9.3h_  

I sat in a chair for about 4 hours a day for 2 days and watched youtube videos about IR blasting and i looked at a lot of github :I, while I was also making my electrical schematic i dont really know if its gonna work, im going to try and have someone look at it and tell me :), but other then that everything went good and decent, hopefully i can move onto the routing and the more fun parts like designing the case!.![Screenshot 2026-01-24 164027](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTAzMDIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--658ad31a4ae3011cc4efd52ddd29398d976ca27f/Screenshot%202026-01-24%20164027.png)
  

## 1/24/2026 8 PM - Fixed an error on my electrical schematic  

_Time spent: 1.2h_  

I was looking over it again to make sure everything was right before i went onto the pcb roughing and design so that I wont have to do it again (Im sure I will :I ) but I hope not ![Screenshot 2026-01-24 203546](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTA0OTksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--5642e3a8837c5494aff9d03f45c773168ec17222/Screenshot%202026-01-24%20203546.png)
  

## 1/26/2026 8:18 PM - Fixed some Errors on the schematic side   

_Time spent: 3.4h_  

I found a lot of errors I needed to fix after i looked over it a 8th time, i also updated my resistors so that they are surface mount instead of holes.![Screenshot 2026-01-26 201703](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTI0OTksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--ed1876d5ca7ec056e7ccc02dda6f88e2727ae4bf/Screenshot%202026-01-26%20201703.png)

_Time spent: 6.6h_  

I forgot to upload my last post when i had done it, but ive just finished routing my pcb and it looks good, hopefully my usb is functional enough to be able to flash program it :)![Screenshot 2026-01-26 201405](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTI1MDEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--78c95affa4d4fca407436eef0bc7704f7b98e535/Screenshot%202026-01-26%20201405.png)![Screenshot 2026-01-26 201400](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTI1MDIsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--e340188527db33d5bcaf8961395fb5e3f049276e/Screenshot%202026-01-26%20201400.png)
